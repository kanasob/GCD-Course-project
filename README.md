Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

This repository contains the files requested for one of Coursera Data Scientist course (Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project) 

The purpose of the project: to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal: to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis 

Requirement : 
1) a tidy data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row name = FALSE, 
2) a link to a Github pository with your script for performing the analysis, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data (CodeBook.md),
4) a README.md in the repository, 
5) a R script in the repository (run_analysis.R)

Dataset
Data Source: data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. For details, see the following link:

The link to the data for the project:

Requirment for R script 
The R script should perform the following:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Changes the name of the activities in the dataset to descriptive name
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
